Last week, we mistakenly sent you a notice with the subject "Your 2017 Final Insurance Enrollment Notice". This notice said that you needed to make a payment update for 2017 health insurance. This notice was sent in error. You do not need to make a payment or take any action for the insurance you receive through your employer.<br/><br/>
If you have any questions, call DC Health Link Customer Service at (855) 532-5465.
